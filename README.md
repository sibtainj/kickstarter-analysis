# kickstarter-analysis Chalenge 1

## Project Overview

This analysis has been completed to better understand the raw data and specifically get to know the percentages of successful, failed and canceled outcomes in the kickstarter data.

### Background
This analysis will help Louise to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. There are charts added to this analysis which will allow the audience to isualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

There were no challenges experienced in this analysis as the data was all setup in a tabular format. We could have had issues in the event the data was not well sorted or if we had some of the dates not entered or formated as dates.

## Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

The chart below shows the number of successful, failed and canceled theater outcomes by launch date.

Based on the above we can conclude the following:

1. This campaign had a huge amount of success during the summer months (May, June, July and Aug).

2. The number of canceled outcomes are very low in the overall campaign.

## Outcomes based on Goals

The chart below shows the percentages of succesful, failed and canceled outcomes based on the goal amounts.

Based on the above we can conclude the following:

Goals that were less than 1000 had the most sucess rate, compared to the ones that were higher than 1000.

### Data Limitations
It seems that the data we have is more on for 2 main contries: US and Canada. It would be good to have more data for all other countries.

### Recommendation for additional tables and graphs

We can also have a table and a chart that shows outcomes based on goals as well as countries.
